            <p>This week I had a conversation with my promotor and mentor and we could establish tasks for me to perform. I felt better because I was stuck.</p>

            <p>I continued to refactor the integration of SauceLabs with the tests, unfortunately the person who reviews my code was too busy, so I have to wait next week in order to know if it is better.</p>

            <p>In the meantime I tried to make a CI/CD pipeline in Gitlab. The CI was not too difficult to make, but I wanted to deploy the code in a kubernetes cluster. Only problem was that I had to make google account with billing details but I do not possess a credit card which was required to create those accounts.</p>

            <p>I then though It would be better to make a CI/CD pipeline in Azure devops, because Tobania has accounts in Azure. I asked someone to give me the accounts, but the problem was they did not have the right subsciption for what I wanted to do.</p>

            <p>I just made a free azure account and began to watch and read tutorials on how to setup a CI/CD pipeline.</p>

            <p>I followed only the beginning of this tutorial (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops-project/azure-devops-project-java) until I had to create an organization. I was directed to Azure Devops and I could create an organization. When this was done I connected my code that is on Gitlab to devops. I also made a connection with Jenkins server. https://www.dragonspears.com/blog/ci-cd-with-jenkins-and-azure-devops-services . I created a service hook so that when code is pushed in the repo, it triggers to run the jenkins pipeline.</p>

            <p>I would like to deploy the app to a kubernetes cluster, It is quite difficult to understand for me. In order to manage it, I follow the tutorials on the docs of Microsoft https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/tutorial-kubernetes-prepare-app</p>

          <p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>

          <p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
