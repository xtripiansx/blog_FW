            <p>This week I tried different ways to connect my azure devops pipeline with the jenkins pipeline. I first had a service hook, that was triggered when there was a push to the source code. It would make a connection to the jenkins server and run a selected build.</p>

            <p>It worked but I was disappointed that there was no visual cues of what was triggered and when it was done. I also did not know what happened in Jenkins. After following some tutorials I decided to make a build pipeline. In the azure-pipeline.yml file I created a Task.</p>

            <p>The task made a connection to the jenkins server and ran the given build. That approach satisfied me, because I saw if failed or passed based on the logs that Jenkins sent to azure devops.</p>

            <p>It took me a while to figure out how to make the pipeline, because I first thought to build the application before, but it was not necessary. Next step was to deploy the application to a Kubernetes cluster, so I began to read some docs.</p>

          <p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>

          <p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
