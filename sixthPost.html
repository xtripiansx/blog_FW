            <p>This week was very exhausting. But in the end I am proud to finally be able to deploy the application to a Kubernetes cluster.</p>

            <p>I mainly followed this tutorial (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/tutorial-kubernetes-prepare-app) to begin to understand and use Kubernetes. I created a Azure Container Registry (ACR, it is a private container registry that lets me securely build and deploy the applications and custom code.</p>

            <p>In order to do so I had to create a resource group on azure. Using the azure CLI I created my ACR that is linked to my resource group. I tagged the images with my ACR server name and pushed them to the ACR.</p>

            <p>Following that I created a kubernetes cluster using the kubernetes CLI. Using a demo project with a kubernetes manifest file, I pushed the demo to my ACR. I had to tag the name of the image with my ACR. This way van I push the manifest file, the image of the demo app will be pushed to my cluster.</p>

            <p>After the deployment was done I could navigate to my cluster and see the demo app hosted.</p>

            <p>I followed the tutorial numerous times because I did not quite understand how it worked. Eventually after reading some documentation I managed to deploy a manifest file of my app to my cluster.</p>

            <p>Next up: writing analyses of docker, kubernetes and linter and reviewing with my mentor what he would like me to implement next.</p>

            <p>This weekend I had to empty our family house so I did not manage to continue my work, but I will catch it up.</p>

            <p>Beginning next week I will work on another project at work. This means that my progress will slow down a bit, unfortunately. BUT I used my remaining day offs for the end of the month so I will have a whole week to work to my hearts content on this Final Work.</p>

            <p></p>

          <p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>

          <p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
